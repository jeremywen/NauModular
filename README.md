This is my personal collection of modules for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/): feel free to use them and modify them as you wish. If you find them useful, feel free to get me a beer.

### Tension
*Tension* is a fixed voltage generator: you turn the knob, you change the voltage. Useful when playing with logic chains or if you need to power up a virtual lamp ;) .

### Function
*Function* is a function generator; it outputs the 3 conic section functions you learned in high school: ellipse, parabola and hyperbola. Input voltage acts as the x variable, while the knob is a constant parameter.

### Perlin
*Perlin* is a [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) generator. It comes with noise speed knob and an amplitude knob. Each knob has its own voltage input with small knob to balance the effect of the signal.
